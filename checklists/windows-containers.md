# Windows Containers support release checklist

- [ ] Test that the "it works" commit can run a task from a real master.
- [ ] Add `docker_containerizer_tests.cpp` to Windows build.
- [ ] All warnings in Mesos code eliminated (warnings generated by third parties or the build system are _highly_ preferable to eliminate, but not blocking).
- [ ] Fix the bug that user-specified environment variables are overridden on Windows paths.

## Backlog

- [ ] Enable Mesos Containers.
- [ ] Consider resolving long paths issue for Windows Server 2012.
- [ ] Consider resolving the symlinks issue for Windows Server 2012.
- [ ] Unify the separate Windows/Unix implementation of the command executor in the same way we did with the DefaultExecutor, _i.e._, use the parenthooks API to get rid of `launchTaskWindows`.
- [ ] Consider forking the Windows isolators (_e.g._, filesystem).
