# Work log 2017-01-05

As always, the current-work dashboard is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12327654#).

## Recap of progress so far

Since many people came back from holiday break on Tuesday or Wednesday, this week it is especially important to consider whether our priorities are correct so that we can be prepared to execute next week.

As a reminder, the general goals for the next ~2 months that we agreed on in early December were:

1. **Dramatically increase code coverage on the Windows agent.** When we started, there were almost no tests enabled for the Windows build of the agent.
1. **Onboard team members from the Open Source Technology Center.**
1. **Complete the CMake build system, deprecate the autotools build system.**
1. **Pave the way for adding agent authentication on Windows.**

In the last few weeks, we have come a long way towards accomplishing goal (1), having lit up more than 500 tests, which is nearly half of the test cases. For goal (2), `andschwa` has submitted a few patches, and is starting to take on larger responsibilities. For goal (3), we are actively working with IBM to complete the CMake work, and hope to have real results in the next few weeks.

Overall, this is good progress, and we are on track to accomplishing our goals for the early March timeframe.

## Accomplished this week

The work this week continues to focus primarily on stabilization, specifically increasing test coverage on Windows code paths, making sure end-to-end tests work with ongoing changes to important infrastructure (particularly file descriptor patches), and getting ready to execute on a plan for CI integration, hopefully next week.

Our main accomplishments are:
* **Completing about 80% of the work required to light up the executor tests.** (See final review in the chain [here](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54677/).)
  * Tracked mostly in [MESOS-6698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6698) and [MESOS-6870](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6870).
  * Most of the work is capped in a 13-review chain ending at [#55162](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55162/), and by Monday, we will have about 75% of the executor tests lit up in `default_executor_tests.cpp` and `command_executor_tests.cpp`.
  * **Impact:** This directly blocks many other tests, including the rest of the `slave_tests.cpp`.
* **Resolved thundering herd bug in agent and framework registration causing about 34 tests to fail on Windows.** Captured in [MESOS-6803](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6803).
  * Specifically affects [MESOS-6714](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6714), but also affects partition tests, API tests, reservation tests, the rest of the slave tests, and so on.
* **Added Windows stack tracing to `glog`.** Pull request is [here](https://github.com/google/glog/pull/151). Once integrated into Mesos, this will cause Agent crashes to emit stack traces.
  * Mesos integration should be up Friday or Monday.

## Focus for the upcoming week

Because of holiday break, we will consolidate some of the tasks that were dropped since last time:

* **[dpravat]** Make sure mpark's file descriptor changes work with the end-to-end tests.
* **[dpravat]** [CONSOLIDATED FROM LAST WEEK] Work to approve get the long paths proposal approved by the core team this week.
  * (Daniel is working on this in his free time, so this may not happen :))
* **[dpravat]** [CONSOLIDATED FROM LAST WEEK] Resolve warning so we can effectively integrate with the Mesos CI. [MESOS-5821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-5821).
  * (Daniel is working on this in his free time, so this may not happen :))
* **[hausdorff]** Resolve [MESOS-6839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6839).
  * Exit criteria: user should be able to successfully request that any task spawned with either the command executor or the default executor can be killed by Mesos successfully. This should no longer be a blocker for `command_executor_tests.cpp` and `default_executor_tests.cpp`.
* **[hausdorff]** Work with Srini (at IBM) to check in the Python and Java protobuf builds in CMake (depending on his and Joseph's availability).
  * Exit criteria: should be able to build Java and Python protobuf bindings on POSIX.
* **[andschwa]** Integrate glog stack traces into Mesos crashes.
* **[andschwa]** [CONSOLIDATED FROM LAST WEEK] Develop plan and timeline for [MESOS-6690](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6690), and continue onboarding.
  * Proposal: concentrate on making sure we understand core abstractions, rather than delivering features at this point.
