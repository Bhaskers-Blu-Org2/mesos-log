# Work log 2017-02-21

As always, the current-work dashboard is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12327654#).

## Review goals for March 1st (tomorrow)

1. Light up all critical-path tests for Windows agent that are currently possible,
   given existing Windows agent feature set.
1. Integrate tests into CI (Mesosphere has agreed to do this and support it).
1. Bring CMake system to feature completeness required to have the autotools deprecation conversation.
   (Note that deprecating autotools will be a multi-week or multi-month discussion,
   and will likely involve more technical work to complete, for example, bug fixes.)
1. Add support for Mesos Containers in the Windows launcher.
1. Integrate Windows Container support.

### Goal Progress made

1. We hit the goal of getting all available critical path tests integrated.
   We still need to light up additional tests, and critical path tests that are not yet available.
1. Mesosphere lit up internal CI, but we still need public CI (i.e. on each patch).
1. CMake feature parity is as close as reasonably expected.
   Need to review [MESOS-6814](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6814).
1. Mesos Container (job object) support for the Windows launcher went up for review,
   but was not yet integerated.
1. Windows Container (Docker) support has been integrated.

## April 1st Goals

1. Turn on `-Werror` i.e. treat warnings as errors, and have an error/warning free build.
1. Bring build times to a tolerable level (less than five minutes for a clean build), probably by introducing pre-compiled headers.
1. Refactor Mesos Container support to use `libprocess` abstraction layer, and port tests.
1. Wire up resource limit APIs to the Mesos Containers using job objects. (Dependent on above.)
1. Port Docker containerizer tests.
1. Move to Visual Studio 2017 (in order to unblock Mesos moving past C++11).
1. Record a demo of the Windows Docker container support for a Mesos meetup.

## Focus for the upcoming week

* **[kaysoky/andschwa]** Introduce CMake solution to dev mailing list and have deprecation discussion.
* **[andschwa]** Rewrite Windows Container using `libprocess` (to help with [MESOS-6868](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6868)).
* **[andschwa]** Integrate Glog stack traces into Mesos crashes [CONSOLIDATED, might have to happen after the `WindowsLauncher` code is integrated.]
* **[andschwa]** Remove Glog redefinition warning.
* **[andschwa]** Benchmark pre-compiled headers build speed improvements.
* **[jeffaco]** Temporarily reassigned to other projects for the week.
* **[johnkord]** Create a test filter for stout tests that use `symlink` on Windows, and continue onboarding.
