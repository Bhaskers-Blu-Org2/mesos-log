# Work log 2017-02-03

As always, the current-work dashboard is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12327654#).

## Goals for March 1

1. **Light up all critical-path tests for Windows agent that are currently posisble, given existing Windows agent feature set.**
1. **Integrate tests into CI (Mesosphere has agreed to do this and support it).**
1. **Bring CMake system to feature completeness required to have the autotools deprecation conversation.** (Note that deprecating autotools will be a multi-week or multi-month discussion, and will likely involve more technical work to complete, for example, bug fixes.)
1. **Add support for Mesos Containers in the Windows launcher.**
1. **Integrate Windows Container support.**

## Current progress on these goals since early December

1. The Windows Containers changes are ready for review, now only blocked by `mpark` checking in the File Descriptor reviews. `hausdorff` and `mpark` fixed these reviews this week, and they should be checked in today (Friday) or Monday. ETA for the Windows Containers reviews is next week, hopefully before Wednesday.
1. The Mesos Containers work: Andy's work on the Windows Launcher works, and is being polished for review. The next chunk of work is to wire up the resource APIs. This should not be more than a couple weeks of work.
1. **[No change since last week]** About 50% of our tests are now lit up in Apache master branch. About 80% of the critical-path tests that can currently be supported (_e.g._, those that do not require auth or persistence in the master) are either in review or checked in. A complete list of critical path tests is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6695), though this does include stuff like the auth tests.
1. Mesosphere has lit up the internal CI. It now broadcasts build status to Mesosphere employees, and the `#windows` channel on the Mesos Slack.
1. **[No change since last week]** The two known issues that remain for CMake feature completeness, [MESOS-3396](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-3396) and [MESOS-6814](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6814), will be completed by EOD Friday (_i.e._, today). The list of issues remaining on this issue is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=(labels%20%3D%20windows-mvp%20OR%20labels%20%3D%20microsoft)%20and%20labels%20%3D%20cmake%20AND%20project%20%3D%20Mesos%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20Accepted)) (all of these except those mentioned above are in still in review since last week).

## Main accomplishments this week

* **Windows Container changes ready for review.**
  * `mpark`'s FD changes, which block these reviews, have been fixed by `hausdorff` and `mpark`, and are nearly ready to check in. ETA Friday (today) or Monday.
  * Following this, the WC reviews are expected to be reviewed and checked in next week, hopefully before Wednesday.

## Focus for the upcoming week

* **[hausdorff]** Complete Windows Containers work.
* **[hausdorff]** Complete CMake work, introduce CMake solution to dev@ list, have deprecation discussion.
* **[hausdorff]** Begin removing compiler warnings from Windows.
* **[andschwa]** Complete [MESOS-6690](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6690), and continue onboarding.
* **[andschwa]** Integrate glog stack traces into Mesos crashes [CONSOLIDATED, might have to happen after the `WindowsLauncher` code is integrated.]
