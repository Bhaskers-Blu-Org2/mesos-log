# Work log 2017-01-27

As always, the current-work dashboard is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12327654#).

## Goals for March 1

1. **Light up all critical-path tests for Windows agent that are currently posisble, given existing Windows agent feature set.**
1. **Integrate tests into CI (Mesosphere has agreed to do this and support it).**
1. **Bring CMake system to feature completeness required to have the autotools deprecation conversation.** (Note that deprecating autotools will be a multi-week or multi-month discussion, and will likely involve more technical work to complete, for example, bug fixes.)
1. **Add support for resource limit APIs in the Windows launcher.**
1. **Integrate Windows Container support.**

## Current progress on these goals since early December

1. `hausdorff` has started working on the Windows Containers changes. If we do not find any serious bugs, we can expect them to be ready by mid- or late- next week.
1. **[No change since last week]** About 50% of our tests are now lit up in Apache master branch. About 80% of the critical-path tests that can currently be supported (_e.g._, those that do not require auth or persistence in the master) are either in review or checked in. A complete list of critical path tests is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6695), though this does include stuff like the auth tests.
1. Mesosphere has committed to Li that the Mesosphere-internal CI will be lit up by mid-next week. We will expect a progress update on Monday.
1. The two known issues that remain for CMake feature completeness, [MESOS-3396](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-3396) and [MESOS-6814](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6814), will be completed by EOD Friday (_i.e._, today). The list of issues remaining on this issue is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=(labels%20%3D%20windows-mvp%20OR%20labels%20%3D%20microsoft)%20and%20labels%20%3D%20cmake%20AND%20project%20%3D%20Mesos%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20Accepted)) (all of these except those mentioned above are in still in review since last week).
1. **[No change since last week]** Andy was off this week. He is still actively working on the resource limit APIs patch. He will be out part of next week, so it's not clear when this work will be completed.

## Main accomplishments this week

* **Began fixing up the Windows Container changes.**
  * This involves sync'ing some somewhat stale changes, and ensuring they work against `mpark`'s file descriptor changes.
  * This does not have a lot of obvious signs of progress, but we are getting closer to resolving this issue, and hope to have it done by the end of next week.

## Focus for the upcoming week

* **[dpravat]** Is busy these next few weeks with his Azure Stack work. We will need to pick up making sure mpark's file descriptor changes work with the end-to-end tests, as well as the work to eliminate warnings.
* **[hausdorff]** Complete Windows Containers work.
* **[andschwa]** Complete [MESOS-6690](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6690), and continue onboarding.
* **[andschwa]** Integrate glog stack traces into Mesos crashes [CONSOLIDATED, might have to happen after the `WindowsLauncher` code is integrated.]
