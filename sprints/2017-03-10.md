# Work log 2017-03-10

As always, the current-work dashboard is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12327654#).

## April 1st Goals

1. Turn on `-Werror` i.e. treat warnings as errors, and have an error/warning free build.
1. Bring build times to a tolerable level (less than five minutes for a clean build), probably by introducing pre-compiled headers.
1. Refactor Mesos Container support to use `libprocess` abstraction layer, and port tests.
1. Wire up resource limit APIs to the Mesos Containers using job objects. (Dependent on above.)
1. Port Docker containerizer tests.
1. Move to Visual Studio 2017 (in order to unblock Mesos moving past C++11).
1. Introduce CMake deprecation to mailing list.

### Extra

1. Record a demo of the Windows Docker container support for a Mesos meetup.
1. Update Mesos documentation for using and developing on Windows.
1. Finally bring in Glog Windows stacktrace port to Mesos.

### Goal Progress made

1. Many warnings have been fixed, more to go.
1. Pre-compiled header work has started, and benchmarks look promising. Integration is underway.
1. Design discussions happened, work is starting.
1. No progress, requires the above first.
1. Not started.
1. Visual Studio 2017 has launched, we can add deprecation warnings. Mesos compiles without error.
1. Message drafted, working on problems brought up in review.

## Focus for the upcoming week

* **[kaysoky/andschwa]** Introduce CMake solution to dev mailing list and have deprecation discussion.
* **[andschwa]** Rewrite Windows Container using `libprocess` (to help with [MESOS-6868](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6868)).
* **[andschwa]** Start updating Mesos documentation for Windows.
* **[jeffaco]** Submit patches enabling pre-compiled headers in CMake.
* **[jeffaco]** Benchmark use of Cotire based pre-compiled headers on Linux.
* **[johnkord]** Create a test filter for stout tests that use `symlink` on Windows, and continue onboarding.
