# Work log 2016-12-09

As always, the current-work dashboard is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12327654#).

## Accomplished this week

Our work this week primarily focused on stabilization, and in particular lighting up tests on Windows builds in the Apache `master` branch (which is possible only now that we've gotten the Master working on Windows). We accomplished all of our major work goals for this week ([see goals here](https://github.com/hausdorff/mesos-msft-log/blob/master/sprints/2016-12-09.md#focus-for-the-upcoming-week)), with some minor consolidations to minor objectives.

Our main accomplishments are:
* **Lighting up and enabling 497 tests (out of about ~1300 total) on Windows builds from the Apache `master` branch.** (See final review in the chain [here](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54677/).)
  * This involved finally resolving [MESOS-6717](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6717), capping off a few weeks' work.
  * Some of these passing tests come from [#54618](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54618/), which enables all trivially-passing tests, and in particular resolving 36% of our ["critical path" test issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6695), specifically issues [MESOS-6700](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6700), [MESOS-6701](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6701), [MESOS-6704](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6704), [MESOS-6710](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6710), [MESOS-6711](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6711), and [MESOS-6716](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6716). This also complese our goal to light up all trivially-passing tests in the Apache `master` branch.
  * Some of these passing tests come from [#54677](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54677/), which makes significant progress on open issues [MESOS-6698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6698), [MESOS-6699](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6699), [MESOS-6703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6703), [MESOS-6705](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6705), [MESOS-6706](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6706), [MESOS-6707](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6707), [MESOS-6709](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6709), [MESOS-6715](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6715).
* We exceeded our goal to have at least one nontrivial agent test lit up, and **lit up ~71% of agent tests in `slave_tests.cpp` alone.**
  * This was days of work, capped off by [#54677](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54677/).
* **We identified and created a realistic roadmap for the remaining "interesting" agent tests.**
  * For example, a lot of this is captured in [MESOS-6803](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6803), a bug that is preventing 45 more tests from working on Windows. There is a realistic timeline in place for resolving it.
* **We created [a proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12osjcB6lr0yaL-d9tbzF5awSTtQb9cVYHYvhhpoKxmY/edit) for dealing with the long paths issue, [MESOS-5849](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-5849).**
* **We have [begun documenting](https://github.com/hausdorff/mesos-msft-log/pull/1) the process of connecting Windows agents to the master, and running tasks on them.** After stabilization, this will probably end up as an issue list to make the process smoother, or it will become part of standard documentation.
* **We continue to onboard new developers.** andschwa has completed a few [starter](https://github.com/apache/mesos/commit/3b61aaea36c778a936c645cd4a7270f8498ef6bd) [bugs](https://github.com/apache/mesos/commit/a0f5caa2f1562a0d7f0247fd1940ed76e5b0f878), and johnkord has had his [first patch](https://github.com/apache/mesos/commit/b6c18c1bd77f3b06832d371c57f29dfb75ea5b26) accepted.

## Focus for the upcoming week

This week people will start dropping out for holiday breaks, so **we do not expect progress to make it into `master` necessarily.** That in mind, our goals for this week are:

* **[dpravat]** Work to approve get the long paths proposal approved by the core team this week.
* **[dpravat]** [CONSOLIDATED FROM LAST WEEK] Resolve warning so we can effectively integrate with the Mesos CI. [MESOS-5821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-5821).
  * (Daniel is working on this in his free time, so this may not happen :))
* **[hausdorff]** Resolve [MESOS-6803](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6803).
  * Exit criterion: we should have added `delay` to the authentication codepath in `Slave::detected`, and all 45 of the tests listed should still pass (on POSIX; on Windows they should at least not fail for the reason listed in this issue. :)) in Apache `master` (or at least in RB, for after the holiday break).
* **[hausdorff]** Work with Srini (at IBM) to check in the Python and Java protobuf builds in CMake (depending on his and Joseph's availability).
  * Exit criteria: should be able to build Java and Python protobuf bindings on POSIX.
* **[hausdorff]** Work to develop timeline for the remainder of `slave_tests.cpp`.
  * Exit criteria: we only have about 29% of the tests left in that file, so absent deep bugs, closing this out should involve at least understanding approximately where the first-order bugs are.
* **[andschwa]** [CONSOLIDATED FROM LAST WEEK] Develop plan and timeline for [MESOS-6690](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6690), and continue onboarding.
  * Proposal: concentrate on making sure we understand core abstractions, rather than delivering features at this point.
* **[johnkord]** Submit a starter patch for [MESOS-5937](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-5937).
  * Same proposal as for `andschwa`. I recommend emphasizing understanding rather than delivering features, at this point.
