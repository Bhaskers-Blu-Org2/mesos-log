# Work log 2017-02-21

As always, the current-work dashboard is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12327654#).

## Goals for March 1

1. **Light up all critical-path tests for Windows agent that are currently possible, given existing Windows agent feature set.**
1. **Integrate tests into CI (Mesosphere has agreed to do this and support it).**
1. **Bring CMake system to feature completeness required to have the autotools deprecation conversation.** (Note that deprecating autotools will be a multi-week or multi-month discussion, and will likely involve more technical work to complete, for example, bug fixes.)
1. **Add support for Mesos Containers in the Windows launcher.**
1. **Integrate Windows Container support.**

## Current progress on these goals since early December

1. **[No change since last week]** About 50% of our tests are now lit up in Apache master branch. About 80% of the critical-path tests that can currently be supported (_e.g._, those that do not require auth or persistence in the master) are either in review or checked in. A complete list of critical path tests is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6695), though this does include stuff like the auth tests.
1. **[No change since last week]** Mesosphere has lit up the internal CI. It now broadcasts build status to Mesosphere employees, and the `#windows` channel on the Mesos Slack, but there are no public facing or per-review builds yet.
1. **[No change since last week]** The two known issues that remain for CMake feature completeness, [MESOS-3396](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-3396) and [MESOS-6814](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6814), will be completed by EOD Friday (_i.e._, today). The list of issues remaining on this issue is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=(labels%20%3D%20windows-mvp%20OR%20labels%20%3D%20microsoft)%20and%20labels%20%3D%20cmake%20AND%20project%20%3D%20Mesos%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20Accepted)) (all of these except those mentioned above are in still in review since last week).
1. **[No change since last week]** Mesos Container (job object) support for the Windows launcher is up for review. Next step is wiring up resource limit APIs.
1. **[No change since last week]** Windows Container (Docker) support has been integrated.

## Main accomplishments this week

This sprint is to reset our Monday schedule, as the last sprint was posted [late last week](2017-02-17.md), so there are no accomplishments to report on. Our tentative April 1st goals are:

1. Turn on `-Werror` i.e. treat warnings as errors, and have an error/warning free build.
1. Bring build times to a tolerable level (less than five minutes for a clean build), probably by introducing pre-compiled headers.
1. Wire up resource limit APIs to the Mesos Containers using job objects.
1. Port remaining tests (this is currently vague, we will have add specifices by March).
1. Move to Visual Studio 2017 (in order to unblock Mesos moving past C++11).

## Focus for the upcoming week

* **[hausdorff]** Introduce CMake solution to dev mailing list and have deprecation discussion.
* **[andschwa]** Complete [MESOS-6690](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6690).
* **[andschwa]** Integrate Glog stack traces into Mesos crashes [CONSOLIDATED, might have to happen after the `WindowsLauncher` code is integrated.]
* **[andschwa]** Remove Glog redefinition warning.
* **[jeffaco]** Benchmark pre-compiled headers build speed improvements, and continue onboarding.
* **[johnkord]** Create a test filter for stout tests that use `symlink` on Windows, and continue onboarding.
