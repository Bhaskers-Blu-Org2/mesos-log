# Work log 2016-12-09

As always, the current-work dashboard is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12327654#).

## Accomplished this week

The main focus of work this week was related to [MESOS-6717](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6717), which is focused on fixing bugs and issues blocking running the Agent and Master, in the Mesos test harness, on Windows, natively. Our primary accomplishments are:

* **Speeding up Agent tests by ~10-15%, on all platforms.** (See [here](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54493/).)
* **Submitting reviews that should do almost all of the work required to resolve [MESOS-6717](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6717), and checking in about 70% of those reviews into the Apache `master` branch.** (See below.)
* **Onboarding new developers!** (Andrew's first bug fix is [here](https://github.com/apache/mesos/commit/fc9a3bbf2c7a34ea2fb00992c94284114b02b6dc).)

A more particular breakdown follows.

* We have fixed a dozen or so bugs or build breaks blocking the Agent, master, or test harness from being built (specifically, [1](fc9a3bbf2c7a34ea2fb00992c94284114b02b6dc), [2](800c629a81dea3002ce5b1e1e29f5479813d64eb), [3](dbffa9d8f9e5ee4cb52b2d4489b1f45b1ddbe3b8), [4](49ccd13fa9cd50adaf11b4aff913a002e8b27cab), [5](60b9f2fff082a52cab02be4d96fa2d4df0261ad0), [6](007f91b49060384a9f5c14375b40688d1b89c0bf), [7](cd1ad28e3baafa22f108830907819be0d727a6b0), [8](cd1ad28e3baafa22f108830907819be0d727a6b0), [9](96e39e04e9618272b8562e2475ce2a46cd770987), [10](fe67ca79ba2fb1da64017226661c63ec8a9441d8), [11](1648491e2f194f5ba9d62cb1e099066fb7f16272), [12](b5b1ead3a8c28b8b65f514fd7b030324a735a26d), and [13](4c0e453296e3ac7c5eda48a98eb7ad570c303d0a)), and several more are in review (specifically: [1](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54515/), [2](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54335/), [3](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54610/), [4](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54514/), [4](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54490/), [5](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54519/), [6](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54489/), [6](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54493/), and [7](https://reviews.apache.org/r/53706/)).
* After these are checked in, we shoudl be able to resolve [MESOS-6717](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6717) (the most major issue we focused on this week), as well as those that block it, particularly [MESOS-6761](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6761).
* MESOS-6717 blocks the rest of the tests issues; once it goes in, there are a few tests that are ready to be committed as well, particularly [MESOS-6701](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6701) (see [review](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54611/)).

## Focus for the upcoming week

Our goals for this week are:

* **[dpravat]** Come up with a proposal for [MESOS-5849](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-5849).
  * This is one of our most-requested issues, and also quite invasive.
* **[dpravat]** Resolve warning so we can effectively integrate with the Mesos CI. [MESOS-5821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-5821).
  * (Daniel is working on this in his free time, so this may not happen :))
* **[hausdorff]** Resolve [MESOS-6717](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6717).
  * Exit criteria are that we should be able to run at least one "interesting" Agent tests out of Apache `master` branch (_i.e._, we need to launch an Agent in the test harness, and have it connect to the Master).
* **[hausdorff]** Add all "trivial" tests to the Agent build. Trivial tests are things like the [recordio review](https://reviews.apache.org/r/54611/), which require no major semantic changes to code to make them work.
* **[hausdorff]** Somewhat-accurate timeline for the Agent command tests.
  * Tracked: [MESOS-6698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6698).
  * Exit criteria is that we understand roughly what is stopping `command_executor_tests.cpp` from building and passing on Windows.
* **[hausdorff]** Bonus goal: understand why [critical path tests](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6695) are failing, and have a timeline for them, too.
* **[andschwa]** Develop plan and timeline for [MESOS-6690](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6690), and continue onboarding.
  * Proposal: concentrate on making sure we understand core abstractions, rather than delivering features at this point.
