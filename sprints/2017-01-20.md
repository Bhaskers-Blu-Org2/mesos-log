# Work log 2017-01-13

As always, the current-work dashboard is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12327654#).

## Goals for March 1

1. **Light up all critical-path tests for Windows agent that are currently posisble, given existing Windows agent feature set.**
1. **Integrate tests into CI (Mesosphere has agreed to do this and support it).**
1. **Bring CMake system to feature completeness required to have the autotools deprecation conversation.** (Note that deprecating autotools will be a multi-week or multi-month discussion, and will likely involve more technical work to complete, for example, bug fixes.)
1. **Add support for resource limit APIs in the Windows launcher.**
1. **Integrate Windows Container support.**

## Current progress on these goals since early December

1. About 50% of our tests are now lit up in Apache master branch. About 80% of the critical-path tests that can currently be supported (_e.g._, those that do not require auth or persistence in the master) are either in review or checked in. A complete list of critical path tests is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6695), though this does include stuff like the auth tests.
1. Mesosphere has lit up the build CI this week. They have gotten side-tracked on lighting up the test CI because of some critical bugs. The
1. Two known issues remain for CMake feature completeness, [MESOS-3396](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-3396) and [MESOS-6814](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6814). The list of issues remaining on this issue is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=(labels%20%3D%20windows-mvp%20OR%20labels%20%3D%20microsoft)%20and%20labels%20%3D%20cmake%20AND%20project%20%3D%20Mesos%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20Accepted)) (all of these except those mentioned above are in review).
1. Andy actively working on the resource limit APIs patch. He will be out part of next week, so it's not clear when this work will be completed.
1. We have not started the work integrating `dpravat`'s Windows Containers work into `master`.

## Main accomplishments this week

* **Greatly progress closing the gap on CMake feature completeness.**
  * MSFT has produced 12 patches ([55599](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55599/), [55600](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55600/), [55601](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55601/), [55602](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55602/), [55604](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55604/), [55607](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55607/), [55632](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55632/), [55637](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55637/), [55694](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55694/), [55695](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55695/), [55696](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55696/), [55748](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55748/)), and IBM has produced 2 ([55686](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55686/), [55657](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55657/)).
  * Together, this leaves 2 tickets left ([MESOS-3396](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-3396), [MESOS-6814](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6814)) on the [outstanding dashboard](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=(labels%20%3D%20windows-mvp%20OR%20labels%20%3D%20microsoft)).
  * After these are checked in, we expect to introduce it to the community, collect bugs and features from the community, and then, after the multi
* **About ~90% of the critical path tests we need to light up, are now lit up.**
  * This week's review [5550](https://reviews.apache.org/r/55550/) caps off this work.

## Focus for the upcoming week

* **[dpravat]** Is busy these next few weeks with his Azure Stack work. We will need to pick up making sure mpark's file descriptor changes work with the end-to-end tests, as well as the work to eliminate warnings.
* **[hausdorff]** Will probably pick up most of this work, we need to sync with `dpravat` to transition this.
* **[andschwa]** Complete [MESOS-6690](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6690), and continue onboarding.
* **[andschwa]** Integrate glog stack traces into Mesos crashes [CONSOLIDATED, might have to happen after the `WindowsLauncher` code is integrated.]
